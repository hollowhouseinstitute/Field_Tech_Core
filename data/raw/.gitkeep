# Raw Data — Field Tech Core

This folder stores **original, unprocessed data** captured from field operations
before any cleaning, anonymization, or transformation has been applied.

Raw data is the first stage in the Field Tech Core pipeline and should be
treated as **sensitive by default**, especially when it includes human
conversations, nervous-system events, or relational logs.

## What belongs here

Examples:

- direct exports from chat platforms or APIs  
- sensor or event logs in their original format  
- CSV / JSON / TXT files received from collaborators or pilots  
- temporary dumps used for initial exploration and cleaning

File examples:

- `co_regulation_logs_raw.csv`  
- `interaction_events_raw.json`  
- `partner_export_YYYYMMDD.csv`

## Handling & Safety

- **Do not** commit identifiable or high-risk personal data to the public repo.  
- Prefer storing truly sensitive raw data in **encrypted, access-controlled
  storage**, and use this folder only for:
  - small, anonymized samples, or  
  - schema examples (with fake data).

- Any movement of files from `data/raw/` → `data/processed/` must follow the
  dataset handling and anonymization rules defined in the  
  **Hollow House Standards Library**.

## Lifecycle

Typical flow:

`data/raw/` → cleaning + validation → anonymization → `data/processed/`

Once a dataset is fully processed and backed up, consider removing the original
raw files from this repo, or keeping only **redacted samples** for reference.
