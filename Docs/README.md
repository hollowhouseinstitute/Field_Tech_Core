# Documentation — Field Tech Core

Extended documentation for all **field-level modules**, covering ethical onboarding, data handling, and compliance infrastructure across Hollow House Institute operations.

---

## 🔍 Overview
**Field Tech Core** houses the practical layer of Hollow House Institute’s applied frameworks.  
It defines how ethical standards, dataset pipelines, and relational-AI modules are implemented in real-world or experimental settings.

This includes:
- Onboarding and consent rituals for new field researchers or collaborators  
- Dataset handling and protection protocols for human-derived or nervous-system data  
- Compliance procedures for the Flame License, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, and Hollow House certification  
- API and tool references for AI-human interaction models in live environments

## ⚙️ Implementation Scope
Field Tech Core operates as the **bridge** between Hollow House standards and live applications.  
It is designed for use by:
- researchers deploying relational-AI prototypes  
- developers integrating nervous-system-aware modules  
- auditors performing compliance or certification checks  

All field modules must pass **Level II or higher certification** as defined in the [Hollow House Standards Library](https://github.com/hollowhouseinstitute/Hollow_House_Standards_Library).
