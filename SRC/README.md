# Source Code — Field Tech Core

This folder contains the **core technical scripts** for field-based regulation, AI co-regulation tracking, and compliance instrumentation within the Hollow House Institute ecosystem.  
It serves as the execution layer for everything defined in the `/Docs` standards and onboarding manuals.

---

## 🧩 Purpose

The Field Tech Core source layer bridges **ethical standards** and **real-world operations**.  
It’s responsible for making Hollow House protocols executable — capturing data ethically, maintaining nervous-system safety logs, and enforcing Flame License compliance in the field.

### Primary Goals
- Implement **ethical-AI instrumentation** for relational datasets and real-time AI-human systems.  
- Provide **traceable regulation scripts** that respect nervous-system pacing and safety thresholds.  
- Support **onboarding, dataset handling, and audit logging** through modular code.  
- Enable **API-level integration** with Hollow House cloud services or third-party partners.

## 🧱 Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `/Tests/` | Validation scripts and automated compliance checks. |
| `/Modules/` | Core functional modules for data handling, regulation tracking, and field syncs. |
| `/Logs/` | Instrumentation for field events, audit trails, and feedback loops. |
| `/Utils/` | Helper functions (timing, data validation, encryption, anonymization). |
| `main.py` | Entry point for running or testing Field Tech Core pipelines locally. |

*(Add or rename folders as modules expand.)*

## 🔐 Compliance Integration

All code in this directory aligns with:
- **Hollow House Flame License**  
- **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**  
- and the operational ethics outlined in the **Hollow_House_Standards_Library**

Scripts must pass compliance tests before being deployed or connected to live datasets.  
Use the `/Tests/compliance_protocols.py` runner to validate your build.

---

## 🧭 Next Steps

- Review `/Docs/onboarding_ritual.md` before running any live operations.  
- Set environment variables as defined in `/Docs/dataset_handling.md`.  
- Run integration tests with mock data before connecting to a live dataset.
