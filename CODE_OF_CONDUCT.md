# Code of Conduct – Field Tech Core

This project is part of the Hollow House Institute ecosystem.

We align with the **Contributor Covenant v2.1**, adapted for relational-ethics research.

---

## Core Principles
- **Respect** all contributors as field participants.
- **Protect** confidential, nervous-system, or lineage data.
- **Acknowledge** original sources and ancestral work.
- **Communicate** transparently; silence ≠ consent.

---

## Enforcement
Reports of misconduct or ethical concern can be sent to  
`ethics@hollowhouseinstitute.org`.

Violation of these terms may lead to removal of contribution rights.

---

> Stewardship over ownership.  
> Regulation over reaction.  
> Truth over territory.
